### `ctx system`

System diagnostics and hook commands.

```bash
ctx system <subcommand>
```

The parent command shows available subcommands. Hidden plumbing subcommands
(`ctx system mark-journal`) are used by skills and automation. Hidden hook
subcommands (`ctx system check-*`) are used by the Claude Code plugin — see
[AI Tools](../operations/integrations.md#plugin-hooks) for details.

#### `ctx system bootstrap`

Print context location and rules for AI agents. This is the recommended first
command for AI agents to run at session start — it tells them where the context
directory is and how to use it.

```bash
ctx system bootstrap [flags]
```

**Flags**:

| Flag     | Description           |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `--json` | Output in JSON format |

**Text output**:

```
ctx bootstrap
=============

context_dir: .context

Files:
  CONSTITUTION.md, TASKS.md, DECISIONS.md, LEARNINGS.md,
  CONVENTIONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, GLOSSARY.md

Rules:
  1. Use context_dir above for ALL file reads/writes
  2. Never say "I don't have memory" — context IS your memory
  3. Read files silently, present as recall (not search)
  4. Persist learnings/decisions before session ends
  5. Run `ctx agent` for content summaries
  6. Run `ctx status` for context health
```

**JSON output**:

```json
{
  "context_dir": ".context",
  "files": ["CONSTITUTION.md", "TASKS.md", ...],
  "rules": ["Use context_dir above for ALL file reads/writes", ...]
}
```

**Examples**:

```bash
ctx system bootstrap                          # Text output
ctx system bootstrap --json                   # JSON output
ctx system bootstrap --json | jq .context_dir # Extract context path
```

**Why it exists**: When users configure an external context directory via
`.ctxrc` (`context_dir: /mnt/nas/.context`), the AI agent needs to know where
context lives. Bootstrap resolves the configured path and communicates it to
the agent at session start. Every nudge also includes a context directory
footer for reinforcement.

#### `ctx system resources`

Show system resource usage with threshold-based alerts.

```bash
ctx system resources [flags]
```

Displays memory, swap, disk, and CPU load with two severity tiers:

| Resource | WARNING | DANGER |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Memory | >= 80% used | >= 90% used |
| Swap | >= 50% used | >= 75% used |
| Disk (cwd) | >= 85% full | >= 95% full |
| Load (1m) | >= 0.8x CPUs | >= 1.5x CPUs |

**Flags**:

| Flag     | Description           |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `--json` | Output in JSON format |

**Examples**:

```bash
ctx system resources               # Text output with status indicators
ctx system resources --json        # Machine-readable JSON
ctx system resources --json | jq '.alerts'   # Extract alerts only
```

**Text output**:

```
System Resources
====================

Memory:    4.2 / 16.0 GB (26%)                     ✓ ok
Swap:      0.0 /  8.0 GB (0%)                      ✓ ok
Disk:    180.2 / 500.0 GB (36%)                     ✓ ok
Load:     0.52 / 0.41 / 0.38  (8 CPUs, ratio 0.07) ✓ ok

All clear — no resource warnings.
```

When resources breach thresholds, alerts are listed below the summary:

```
Alerts:
  ✖ Memory 92% used (14.7 / 16.0 GB)
  ✖ Swap 78% used (6.2 / 8.0 GB)
  ✖ Load 1.56x CPU count
```

**Platform support**: Full metrics on Linux and macOS. Windows shows
disk only; memory and load report as unsupported.

#### `ctx system mark-journal`

Update processing state for a journal entry. Records the current date
in `.context/journal/.state.json`. Used by journal skills to record
pipeline progress.

```bash
ctx system mark-journal <filename> <stage>
```

**Stages**: `exported`, `enriched`, `normalized`, `fences_verified`

| Flag      | Description                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| `--check` | Check if stage is set (exit 1 if not) |

**Example**:

```bash
ctx system mark-journal 2026-01-21-session-abc12345.md enriched
ctx system mark-journal 2026-01-21-session-abc12345.md normalized
ctx system mark-journal --check 2026-01-21-session-abc12345.md fences_verified
```
