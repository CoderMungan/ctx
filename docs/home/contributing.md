## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* [Go](https://go.dev/) (*version defined in [`go.mod`](https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/blob/main/go.mod)*)
* [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Zensical](https://github.com/zensical/zensical)

### 1. Fork (*or Clone*) the Repository

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<you>/ctx.git
cd ctx

# Or, if you have push access:
git clone https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx.git
cd ctx
```

### 2. Build and Install the Binary

```bash
make build
sudo make install
```

This compiles the `ctx` binary and places it in `/usr/local/bin/`.

### 3. Install the Plugin from Your Local Clone

The repository ships a Claude Code plugin under `internal/assets/claude/`.
Point Claude Code at your local copy so that skills and hooks reflect
your working tree — no reinstall needed after edits:

1. Launch `claude`;
2. Type `/plugin` and press Enter;
3. Select **Marketplaces** → **Add Marketplace**
4. Enter the **absolute path** to the root of your clone,
   e.g. `~/WORKSPACE/ctx`
   (*this is where `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lives: it points
   Claude Code to the actual plugin in `internal/assets/claude`*);
5. Back in `/plugin`, select **Install** and choose `ctx`.

!!! warning "Claude Code Caches Plugin Files"
    Even though the marketplace points at a directory on disk, Claude Code
    **caches** skills and hooks. 

    After editing files under
    `internal/assets/claude/`, you must bump the plugin version and
    refresh the marketplace. 
    
    See [Skill or Hook Changes](#skill-or-hook-changes) for the steps.

### 4. Verify

```bash
ctx --version       # binary is in PATH
claude /plugin list # plugin is installed
```

You should see the `ctx` plugin listed, sourced from your local path.

### Skills: Two Directories, One Rule

| Directory                        | What lives here                                 | Distributed to users? |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
<!-- drift-check: ls internal/assets/claude/skills/ | wc -l -->
| `internal/assets/claude/skills/` | The 29 `ctx-*` skills that ship with the plugin | Yes                   |
| `.claude/skills/`                | Dev-only skills (release, QA, backup, etc.)     | No                    |

**`internal/assets/claude/skills/`** is the single source of truth for
user-facing skills. If you are adding or modifying a `ctx-*` skill,
edit it there.

**`.claude/skills/`** holds skills that only make sense inside this
repository (*release automation, QA checks, backup scripts*). These are
never distributed to users.

----

## Day-to-Day Workflow

### Go Code Changes

After modifying Go source files, rebuild and reinstall:

```bash
make build && sudo make install
```

The `ctx` binary is statically compiled. There is no hot reload.
You must rebuild for Go changes to take effect.

### Skill or Hook Changes

Edit files under `internal/assets/claude/skills/` or
`internal/assets/claude/hooks/`.

After making changes, update the plugin version and refresh the marketplace:

1. Bump the version in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
   (*the `plugins[0].version` field*);
2. Bump the version in `internal/assets/claude/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   (*the top-level `version` field*);
3. *(Optional but recommended)* Update `VERSION` to match:
   keeping all three in sync avoids confusion;
4. In Claude Code, type `/plugin` and press Enter;
5. Select **Marketplaces** → **activememory-ctx**;
6. Select **Update marketplace**;
7. Restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect.

### Running Tests

```bash
make test   # fast: all tests
make audit  # full: fmt + vet + lint + drift + docs + test
make smoke  # build + run basic commands end-to-end
```

### Running the Docs Site Locally

```bash
make site-setup  # one-time: install zensical via pipx
make site-serve  # serve at localhost
```

## Submitting Changes

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicating effort;
2. For large changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach;
3. Read the specs in `specs/` for design context.

### Pull Request Process

Respect the maintainers' time and energy:
Keep your pull requests **isolated** and strive to minimze code changes.

If you Pull Request solves more than one distinct issues, it's better to create
separate pull requests instead of sending them in one large bundle.

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`;
2. Make your changes;
3. Run `make audit` to catch issues early;
4. Commit with a **clear message**;
5. Push and open a pull request.

!!! tip "Audit Your Code Before Submitting"
    Run `make audit` before submitting:

    `make audit` covers formatting, vetting, linting, drift checks, 
    doc consistency, and tests in one pass.

### Commit Messages

Following conventional commits is recommended but not required:

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`

Examples:

* `feat(cli): add ctx export command`
* `fix(drift): handle missing files gracefully`
* `docs: update installation instructions`

### Code Style

* Follow Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`);
* Keep functions **focused** and **small**;
* Add tests for new functionality;
* Handle errors explicitly.
