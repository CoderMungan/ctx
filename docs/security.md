## Reporting Vulnerabilities

At `ctx` we take security very seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability in `ctx`, please report it responsibly.

**Do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### Email

Send details to **security@ctx.ist**

### GitHub Private Reporting

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide a detailed description

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

| Stage              | Timeframe                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Acknowledgment     | Within 48 hours                        |
| Initial assessment | Within 7 days                          |
| Resolution target  | Within 30 days (depending on severity) |

## Trust Model

`ctx` operates within a single trust boundary: **the local filesystem**.

The person who authors `.context/` files is the same person who runs the
agent that reads them. There is no remote input, no shared state, and no
server component.

This means:

* **`ctx` does not sanitize context files for prompt injection.** This is a
  deliberate design choice, not an oversight. The files are authored by the
  developer who owns the machine: Sanitizing their own instructions back
  to them would be counterproductive.
* **If you place adversarial instructions in your own `.context/` files,
  your agent will follow them.** This is expected behavior. You control the
  context; the agent trusts it.

!!! warning "Shared Repositories"
    In shared repositories, `.context/` files should be reviewed in code
    review (*the same way you would review CI/CD config or Makefiles*). A
    malicious contributor could add harmful instructions to
    `CONSTITUTION.md` or `TASKS.md`.

## Security Design

`ctx` is designed with security in mind:

* **No secrets in context**: The constitution explicitly forbids storing
  secrets, tokens, API keys, or credentials in `.context/` files
* **Local only**: `ctx` runs entirely locally with no external network calls
* **No code execution**: ctx reads and writes Markdown files only; it does
  not execute arbitrary code
* **Git-tracked**: Core context files are meant to be committed, so they should
  never contain sensitive data. Exception: `sessions/` and `journal/` contain
  raw conversation data and should be gitignored

## Best Practices

1. **Review before committing**: Always review `.context/` files before committing
2. **Use .gitignore**: If you must store sensitive notes locally,
   add them to `.gitignore`
3. **Drift detection**: Run `ctx drift` to check for potential issues

## Attribution

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge security researchers
who report valid vulnerabilities (*unless they prefer to remain anonymous*).
