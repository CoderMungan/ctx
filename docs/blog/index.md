### [ctx v0.2.0: The Archaeology Release](2026-02-01-ctx-v0.2.0-the-archaeology-release.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 1, 2026*

What if your AI could remember everything? Not just the current session, but
every session. v0.2.0 introduces the recall and journal systems—making 86
commits of history searchable, exportable, and analyzable. This post tells
the story of why those features exist.

**Topics**: session recall, journal system, structured entries, token budgets,
meta-tools

### [Refactoring with Intent: Human-Guided Sessions in AI Development](2026-02-01-refactoring-with-intent.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / February 1, 2026*

YOLO mode shipped 14 commands in a week. But technical debt doesn't send
invoices—it just waits. This is the story of what happened when we stopped
auto-accepting everything and started guiding the AI with intent: 27 commits
across 4 days, a major version release, and lessons that apply far beyond ctx.

**Topics**: refactoring, code quality, documentation standards, module
decomposition, YOLO vs intentional development

### [Building ctx Using ctx: A Meta-Experiment in AI-Assisted Development](2026-01-27-building-ctx-using-ctx.md)

*Jose Alekhinne / January 27, 2026*

What happens when you build a tool designed to give AI memory, using that very
same tool to remember what you're building? This is the story of ctx—how it
evolved from a hasty "YOLO mode" experiment to a disciplined system for
persistent AI context, and what we learned along the way.

**Topics**: dogfooding, AI-assisted development, Ralph Loop, session
persistence, architectural decisions
