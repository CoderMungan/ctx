## The Problem

Not every session needs the full ceremony. Quick investigations, one-off
questions, small fixes unrelated to active project work: These tasks
don't benefit from persistence nudges, ceremony reminders, or knowledge
checks. Every hook still fires, consuming tokens and attention on work
that won't produce learnings or decisions worth capturing.

## TL;DR

| Command                       | What it does                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `ctx hook pause` or `/ctx-pause`   | Silence all nudge hooks for this session |
| `ctx hook resume` or `/ctx-resume` | Restore normal hook behavior             |

Pause is **session-scoped**: It only affects the current session.
Other sessions (same project, different terminal) are unaffected.

## What Gets Paused

All nudge and reminder hooks go silent:

* Context size checkpoints
* Ceremony adoption nudges
* Persistence reminders
* Journal maintenance reminders
* Knowledge growth nudges
* Map staleness nudges
* Version update nudges
* Resource pressure warnings
* QA reminders
* Post-commit nudges
* Specs nudges
* Backup age warnings
* Context load gate
* Pending reminders relay

## What Still Fires

**Security hooks** always run, even when paused:

* `block-non-path-ctx`: prevents `./ctx` invocations
* `block-dangerous-commands`: blocks `sudo`, force push, etc.

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Session starts: Context loads normally.

# 2. You realize this is a quick task
ctx hook pause

# 3. Work without interruption: hooks are silent

# 4. Session evolves into real work? Resume first
ctx hook resume

# 5. Now wrap up normally
# /ctx-wrap-up
```

## Graduated Reminder

Paused hooks aren't completely invisible. A minimal indicator appears so
you always know the state:

| Paused turns | What you see                                    |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1-5          | `ctx:paused`                                    |
| 6+           | `ctx:paused (N turns): resume with /ctx-resume` |

This prevents the "forgot I paused" problem during long sessions.

## Tips

- **Resume before wrapping up.** If your quick task turns into real work,
  resume hooks before running `/ctx-wrap-up`. The wrap-up ceremony needs
  active hooks to capture learnings properly.

- **Initial context load is unaffected.** The ~8k token startup injection
  (CLAUDE.md, playbook, constitution) happens before any command runs.
  Pause only affects hooks that fire *during* the session.

- **Use for quick investigations.** Debugging a stack trace? Checking a
  git log? Answering a colleague's question? Pause, do the work, close
  the session. No ceremony needed.

- **Don't use for real work.** If you're implementing features, fixing
  bugs, or making decisions: keep hooks active. The nudges exist to
  prevent context loss.
