!!! tip "Commands vs. Skills"
    **Commands** (`ctx status`, `ctx add task`) run in your
    terminal.

    **Skills** (`/ctx-reflect`, `/ctx-next`) run inside
    your AI coding assistant.

    Recipes combine both.

    Think of commands as **structure** and skills as **behavior**.

## Proactive Behavior

These recipes show explicit commands and skills, but agents
trained on the `ctx` playbook are **proactive**: they offer to
save learnings after debugging, record decisions after
trade-offs, create follow-up tasks after completing work, and
suggest what to work on next.

**Your questions train the agent.** Asking "*what have we
learned?*" or "*is our context clean?*" does two things:

* It triggers the workflow right now,
* **and** it **reinforces** the pattern.

The more you guide, the more the agent **habituates** the behavior and begins
offering on its own.

Each recipe includes a **Conversational Approach** section
showing these natural-language patterns.

!!! tip Help Your Agent Help You
    Don't wait passively for proactive behavior: especially in
    early sessions.

    **Ask, guide, reinforce.** Over time, you ask less and
    the agent offers more.
