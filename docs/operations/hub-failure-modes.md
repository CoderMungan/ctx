# `ctx` Hub: Failure Modes

What can go wrong, what the system does about it, and what you
should do. Complementary to
[`ctx` Hub Operations](hub.md).

!!! info "Design Posture"
    The hub is **best-effort knowledge sharing**, not a durable
    ledger. Local `.context/` files are the source of truth for
    each project; the hub is a fan-out channel. This framing
    informs every failure-mode decision below.

## Network

### Client Loses Connection Mid-Stream

**What happens:** `ctx connection listen` detects the EOF, waits
with exponential backoff, and reconnects. On reconnect it passes
its last-seen sequence; the hub replays everything newer.

**What you should do:** nothing. If reconnects are looping, check
firewall state on the hub and `ctx hub status` output.

### Slow Listener Disconnected

**What happens:** each `ctx connection listen` stream gets a
buffered fan-out channel. A client that stops draining it (paused
process, saturated link, a laptop that went to sleep) fills the
buffer. Rather than block every publisher or silently discard the
client's entries, the hub disconnects that one listener and closes
its channel. The client sees an EOF and reconnects with its
last-seen sequence, so the missed entries are replayed. Nothing is
lost; the reconnect is the recovery.

Each disconnect writes a warning to the hub's stderr and increments
a cumulative counter reported as `Dropped listeners:` in
`ctx hub status`.

**What you should do:** an occasional disconnect is normal and
self-healing. A count that climbs steadily means listeners cannot
keep up with the publish rate — check the listening client's health
and the link to it before assuming the hub is at fault.

### Partition: Majority Side Reachable

**What happens:** clients routed to the majority side continue to
publish and listen. The minority nodes step down to followers
that cannot accept writes (Raft quorum lost).

**What you should do:** let it heal. When the partition closes,
followers catch up via sequence-based sync automatically.

### Partition: Split Brain (No Quorum)

**What happens:** no node holds a majority, so no leader is
elected. All nodes become read-only. `ctx connection publish` and
`ctx add --share` fail with a "no leader" error; local writes
still succeed.

**What you should do:** fix the network. If the partition is
permanent (e.g., a data center is gone), bootstrap a new cluster
from the survivors with `ctx hub peer remove` for the dead nodes.

### Hub Unreachable during `ctx add --share`

**What happens:** the local write succeeds; the share step prints
a warning and exits non-zero on the share leg only. `--share` is
best-effort; it never blocks local context updates.

**What you should do:** run `ctx connection publish` later to
backfill, or rely on another `--share` for the same entry ID.
The hub deduplicates by entry ID.

## Storage

### Disk Full on the Leader

**What happens:** `entries.jsonl` append fails. The hub rejects
writes with an error and stays up for read traffic. Clients
retry; followers keep their in-sync status using whatever the
leader already wrote.

**What you should do:** free disk or grow the volume, then
nothing else; the hub resumes accepting writes on the next
append attempt.

### Corrupt `entries.jsonl`

**What happens:** if the last line is a partial JSON write from a
crash, the hub truncates it on startup and logs a warning. If any
earlier line is malformed, the hub refuses to start.

**What you should do:** inspect with
`jq -c . <data-dir>/entries.jsonl > /dev/null` to find the bad
line. Move the bad region to a `.quarantine` file, then start.
Nothing is ever silently dropped.

### `meta.json` / `entries.jsonl` Sequence Mismatch

**What happens:** the hub refuses to start. This usually means
someone copied one file without the other.

**What you should do:** restore both files from the same backup,
or accept the higher sequence by regenerating `meta.json` from
`entries.jsonl` (manual for now; file a bug).

## Cluster

### Leader Crash, Clean Shutdown

**What happens:** `ctx hub stop` triggers `stepdown` first, so
a new leader is elected before the old one exits. In-flight
writes drain. Clients reconnect to the new leader transparently.

### Leader Crash, Hard Fail (Kill -9, Power Loss)

**What happens:** Raft detects the missing heartbeat and elects
a new leader within a few seconds. Writes the old leader accepted
**but had not yet replicated** can be lost. See the Raft-lite
warning in [the cluster recipe](../recipes/hub-cluster.md).

**What you should do:** if you need stronger durability, run
`ctx connection listen` on a dedicated "collector" project that
persists entries locally as a write-ahead backup.

### Split-Brain After Rejoin

**What happens:** Raft reconciles: the minority side's uncommitted
writes are discarded, and the majority's log is authoritative.

**What you should do:** nothing automatic. If you know the
minority had important writes, grep for them in
`<data-dir>/entries.jsonl.rejected` (written by the reconciliation
pass) and replay them with `ctx connection publish`.

## Auth and Tokens

### Lost Admin Token

**What happens:** you cannot register new projects.

**What you should do:** retrieve it from
`<data-dir>/admin.token`. If that file is also gone, stop the hub
and regenerate. Note that **all existing client tokens keep
working**; only new registrations need the admin token.

### Compromised Admin Token

**What happens:** anyone with the token can register new
projects and publish. They cannot read existing entries without
a client token for a project that subscribes.

**What you should do:** rotate the admin token
(regenerate `<data-dir>/admin.token` and restart), revoke
suspicious client registrations via `clients.json`, and audit
`entries.jsonl` for unexpected origins.

### Compromised Client Token

**What happens:** the attacker can publish as that project and
read anything that project is subscribed to. Because `Origin`
is self-asserted on publish, the attacker can also publish
entries tagged with **any other project's** name, so
attribution in `entries.jsonl` cannot be trusted after a
token compromise.

**What you should do:** remove the client's entry from
`clients.json`, restart the hub, and re-register the legitimate
project with a fresh token. Audit `entries.jsonl` for entries
published after the compromise timestamp and quarantine any
that look suspicious; remember that `Origin` on those entries
proves nothing.

### Compromised Hub Host

**What happens:** `<data-dir>/clients.json` stores client
tokens **verbatim** (not hashed). Anyone with read access to
that file has every client token in hand and can impersonate
any registered project until each one is rotated.

**What you should do:** treat it as a total hub compromise.
Stop the hub, wipe `<data-dir>` (keep a forensic copy first),
regenerate the admin token, and have every client re-register.
See [Security model](../security/hub.md#hub-side-token-storage)
for the mitigations that reduce the blast radius while the
hashing follow-up is pending.

## Clock Skew

Hub entries carry a timestamp assigned **by the publishing
client**. The hub does not rewrite timestamps. Clients with
significant clock skew will publish entries that look out of
order in the shared feed.

**What you should do:** run NTP on all client machines. If you
see entries dated in the future or far past, the publisher's
clock is the culprit.

## The Short List

| Symptom                           | First thing to check              |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Client can't reach hub            | Firewall, then `ctx hub status`   |
| "No leader" errors                | Cluster quorum; run `ctx hub status` on each peer |
| Hub won't start after crash       | Last line of `entries.jsonl`      |
| Entries missing after restore     | Check `clients.json` sequence vs local `.sync-state.json` |
| Duplicate entries in shared feed  | Client replayed after restore, safe (dedup by ID) |
| Followers lagging                 | Disk or network on the follower, not the leader |
