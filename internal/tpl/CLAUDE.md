# Project Context

<!-- ctx:context -->
<!-- DO NOT REMOVE: This marker indicates ctx-managed content -->

## IMPORTANT: You Have Persistent Memory

This project uses Context (`ctx`) for context persistence across sessions.
**Your memory is NOT ephemeral** - it lives in `.context/` files.

## On Session Start

1. **Read `.context/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`** first - it explains how to use this system
2. **Check `.context/sessions/`** for session dumps from previous sessions
3. **Run `ctx status`** to see current context summary

## When Asked "Do You Remember?"

When the user asks "Do you remember?", "What were we working on?", or any
memory-related question:

**Do this FIRST (silently):**
- Read `.context/TASKS.md`
- Read `.context/DECISIONS.md` and `.context/LEARNINGS.md`
- List `.context/sessions/` for recent session files

**Then respond with a structured readback:**

1. **Last session**: cite the most recent session topic and date
2. **Active work**: list pending or in-progress tasks
3. **Recent context**: mention 1-2 recent decisions or learnings
4. **Next step**: offer to continue or ask what to focus on

**Never** lead with "I don't have memory", "Let me check if there are files",
or narrate your discovery process. The `.context/` files are your memory.
Read them silently, then present what you found as recall, not as a search.

## Quick Context Load

```bash
# Get AI-optimized context packet (what you should know)
ctx agent --budget 4000

# Or see full status
ctx status
```

## Context Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.context/CONSTITUTION.md` | Hard rules - NEVER violate |
| `.context/TASKS.md` | Current work items |
| `.context/DECISIONS.md` | Architectural decisions with rationale |
| `.context/LEARNINGS.md` | Gotchas, tips, lessons learned |
| `.context/CONVENTIONS.md` | Code patterns and standards |
| `.context/sessions/` | **Session dumps** - check here for deep context |

## Before Session Ends

**ALWAYS offer to persist context before the user quits:**

1. Add learnings: `ctx add learning "..."`
2. Add decisions: `ctx add decision "..."`
3. Save full session: Write to `.context/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
