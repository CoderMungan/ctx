## [2026-08-23-125635] Codex trust and hook wiring facts verified against codex 0.148

**Context**: Live-tested the ctx Codex integration with codex exec on Codex CLI 0.148.0.

**Lesson**: (1) Project .codex/hooks.json loads only when the project path is trusted in the REAL ~/.codex/config.toml; a -c 'projects."...".trust_level="trusted"' CLI override is ignored for trust. (2) SessionStart plain-text stdout is injected verbatim as a developer message. (3) Codex's code-mode unified exec matches hook matcher 'Bash', and the legacy {"decision":"block"} shape blocks it. (4) SessionEnd hooks fire on codex exec process exit and ctx journal import completes within the 3 s cap. (5) trust for a parent dir (/Users/x) does NOT extend to subdirectories.

**Application**: When debugging 'ctx hooks not firing in Codex', check project trust in ~/.codex/config.toml first; do not suggest -c trust overrides.

## [2026-08-23-125635] hack scripts must survive macOS /bin/bash 3.2 and BSD grep

**Context**: make audit failed on macOS with 'unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote' in hack/lint-docstrings.sh (shebang #!/bin/bash = macOS bash 3.2.57). Root cause: bash 3.2's $( ) re-parser treats an apostrophe inside a COMMENT (didn't) as an open quote. Separately, the script's grep -cP (PCRE) silently fails on BSD grep, turning fieldcount empty and emitting 59 MISSING_FIELDS false positives.

**Lesson**: Two portability traps in hack/*.sh: (1) no apostrophes in comments inside command substitutions (bash 3.2 chokes); (2) no grep -P (BSD grep lacks PCRE) — use grep -E with a literal tab via TAB=$(printf '\t') and [[:space:]]. CI on Linux hides both.

**Application**: When adding hack scripts, test with /bin/bash (not Homebrew bash) on macOS; prefer 'did not' over contractions in comments inside $( ); use grep -E with POSIX classes.

## [2026-08-23-125635] make lint SA5011 false positives mean a corrupted golangci-lint cache

**Context**: make lint failed with 6 staticcheck SA5011 'possible nil pointer dereference' findings in test files untouched by the branch (if x == nil { t.Fatal } followed by x.Field). The flagged file set VARIED between runs (serve/compat one run, bootstrap/init the next).

**Lesson**: Nondeterministic staticcheck SA5011 on the guarded nil-check pattern is a corrupted golangci-lint build cache, not real findings. 'golangci-lint cache clean && make lint' returned 0 issues.

**Application**: Before chasing staticcheck findings in files a branch never touched, check whether the finding set is stable across two runs; if it varies, clean the golangci-lint cache first.

---

## [2026-07-25-124457] Using the proprietary sibling repo as design evidence leaks its internals into tracked files

**Context**: While deciding the pd-m4 add-path shape, I read the sibling repo's convention file to settle the question, then quoted its guide text and attributed the decision to it in a tracked plan file. An unrelated build warning prompted the sweep that caught it.

**Lesson**: The leak vector is not NAMING the sibling (allowed) — it is citing its designs or guide text as evidence in tracked specs/plans. Both the quote and the attribution are leaks.

**Application**: Cite ctx's OWN files as design evidence and describe designs on their merits; never quote or attribute to the sibling in tracked files; git grep the staged tree before committing any spec authored while consulting it. Per specs/public-repo-hygiene.md.

---

## [2026-07-25-124457] Skill and doc examples of a serialized structure must round-trip through the real parser

**Context**: The ctx-digest skill documented digest-plan entries as JSON strings, but Assignment.Entries is []StagedEntry{timestamp,title}; the documented form failed json.Unmarshal. Latent since M3 — any agent following the skill verbatim failed at the apply step.

**Lesson**: A hand-authored example of a serialized structure drifts from the code silently; nothing tests the prose.

**Application**: Verify skill/doc JSON/YAML examples against the actual unmarshal target — build the binary and run the exact documented command — before shipping the skill.

---

## [2026-07-25-124457] A guard derived from a capability accessor silently lifts when the accessor is extended

**Context**: pd-m4 T04 made ThemeDir(convention) return true; Apply's refusal of the convention kind was DERIVED from ThemeDir returning false. That one-line 'vocabulary' change silently opened the destructive mover to CONVENTIONS.md before the convention parse/validate/dup-title paths existed. Caught by TestApply_Refusals.

**Lesson**: When a refusal is derived from a capability check (if !capable { refuse }) instead of an explicit guard, extending that capability lifts the refusal as an invisible side effect — and the two tasks look independent in the plan.

**Application**: Before extending a capability accessor, grep for guards that read it. When a multi-task arc will open a destructive path, add an EXPLICIT gate that the opening task removes deliberately, so it cannot open early.

---

## [2026-07-19-210439] The disclosure parser is a deliberately dumb line-scanner (skips <!-- --> comments, not code fences)

**Context**: M4 unifies conventions into the ## -section entry model, where ## collides far more than ## [. Fence detection was considered and rejected.

**Lesson**: Fence detection (nested/tilde/indented fences) is a rabbit hole in a parser that does destructive moves. Safety comes from byte-conservation (a mis-cut is a reversible mis-grouping, not loss) plus the human-gated plan review (a false entry shows up at inspect).

**Application**: Don't add fence-awareness to the disclosure scanner; a stray ## inside a fenced code block is fixed at authoring time (rewrite that one line), never by the tool.

---

## [2026-07-19-210439] Measurement gates surface a real bug in every disclosure milestone

**Context**: pd-m1's add-path measurement gate flushed the insert.AfterHeader tail-truncation bug; pd-m3's T17 real rollout surfaced the DECISIONS-template comment-parse bug (a ## [ inside <!-- --> read as staging, so Validate returned ErrStagingUnparsable once the fold emptied real staging).

**Lesson**: For the disclosure work, driving the REAL fold — not unit tests — is where bugs hide. The measurement gate is not ceremony.

**Application**: Treat pd-m4 T20 (drive the digest on the real CONVENTIONS.md) as the authoritative gate; expect it to find something; verify conservation + all invariants on the real file before T21's human-gated rollout.
