# Tasks

<!--
STRUCTURE RULES (see CONSTITUTION.md):
- Tasks stay in their Phase section permanently — never move them
- Use inline labels: #in-progress, #blocked, #priority:high
- Mark completed: [x], skipped: [-] (with reason)
- Never delete tasks, never remove Phase headers
TASK STATUS LABELS:
- `[ ]` — pending
- `[x]` — completed
- `[-]` — skipped (with reason)
- `#in-progress` — currently being worked on (add inline, don't move task)
-->

### Phase -1: Quality Verification




- [-] internal/claude/hooks/registry.go -> — truncated stub, intent unknown; registry is at internal/assets/hooks/messages/ and appears complete

### Phase GK: Global Encryption Key — Spec: `specs/global-encryption-key.md`

- [-] GK.6: Update ARCHITECTURE.md and DETAILED_DESIGN.md for new key resolution model — no references to old paths found in either file #added:2026-03-02-114146










### Phase -2: Housekeeping (Clean Before Renovating)

No broken windows. These fix structural issues in state management,
directory layout, and agent hygiene before adding new features.

Spec: `specs/user-level-dir-relocation.md`, `specs/state-consolidation.md`,
`specs/task-completion-nudge.md`. Read the specs before starting any P-2 task.

**Init guard and state consolidation:**



**User-level directory relocation:**

- [-] P-2.3: Relocate user-level dir from ~/.local/ctx to ~/.ctx — superseded by Phase GK (global encryption key at ~/.ctx/.ctx.key)
  Spec: `specs/user-level-dir-relocation.md`
  #priority:high #added:2026-03-01

- [-] P-2.4: Update docs for ~/.ctx key path — superseded by GK.5 and GK.6
  Spec: `specs/user-level-dir-relocation.md`
  #priority:high #added:2026-03-01

**Task completion nudge:**


### Phase -0.5: Hack Script Absorption

Absorb remaining `hack/` scripts into Go subcommands. Eliminates shell
dependencies, improves portability, and makes the skill layer call `ctx`
directly instead of `make` targets.

**Remaining candidates (from review):**


- [-] P-0.5.2: Evaluate `hack/context-watch.sh` for absorption as `ctx watch` or
  `ctx system watch` — deleted instead; heartbeat now includes token telemetry
  (tokens, context_window, usage_pct) making the watch script redundant.
  #priority:low #added:2026-03-01 #done:2026-03-01

### Phase 0.9: Suppress Nudges After Wrap-Up

Spec: `specs/suppress-nudges-after-wrap-up.md`. Read the spec before starting
any P0.9 task.

**Phase 3 — Skill integration:**


- [-] P0.9.2: Split cli-reference.md — moved to Future
  #added:2026-02-24-204208

- [-] P0.9.3: Investigate proactive content suggestions — moved to Future
  #added:2026-02-24-185754

### Phase 0.8: RSS/Atom Feed Generation (`ctx site feed`)

Spec: `specs/rss-feed.md`. Read the spec before starting any P0.8 task.

**Phase 4 — Tests and integration:**

- [-] P0.8.2: Investigate converting UserPromptSubmit hooks to JSON output —
  Skipped: VERBATIM boxes ARE the feature (human-readable nudges injected into
  agent prompt). JSON would make them less useful. External tooling already gets
  structured JSON via webhooks. #added:2026-02-22-194446



### Phase 0.4: Hook Message Templates

Spec: `specs/future-complete/hook-message-templates.md`. Read the spec before
starting any P0.4 task.

**Phase 2 — Discoverability + documentation:**

Spec: `specs/future-complete/hook-message-customization.md`.

### Phase 0.4.9: Injection Oversize Nudge

Spec: `specs/injection-oversize-nudge.md`. Read the spec before starting
any P0.4.9 task.

### Phase 0.4.10: Context Window Token Usage

Spec: `specs/context-window-usage.md`. Read the spec before starting any
P0.4.10 task.

### Phase 0.6: Plugin Enablement Gap

Ref: `ideas/plugin-enablement-gap.md`. Local-installed plugins get registered
in `installed_plugins.json` but not auto-added to `enabledPlugins`, so slash
commands are invisible in non-ctx projects.

### Prompting Guide — Canonical Reference

- [-] PG.1: Agent/tool compatibility matrix — moved to Future
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-25

- [-] PG.2: Versioning/stability note — moved to Future
      #priority:low #added:2026-02-25

### Phase 0: Ideas (drift markers)

- [-] P0.1: Standardize drift-check comment format — moved to Future. AI parses
  ad-hoc markers fine; standardization benefits tooling/CLI but not urgent.
  #priority:medium #added:2026-02-28

### Phase 0: Ideas (from competitive analysis)




### Phase 0: Ideas

**User-Facing Documentation** (from `ideas/done/REPORT-7-documentation.md`):
Docs are feature-organized, not problem-organized. Key structural improvements:

- [x] P0.6: Use-case page: "My AI Keeps Making the Same Mistakes" — problem-first
      page showcasing DECISIONS.md and CONSTITUTION.md. Partially covered in
      about.md but deserves standalone treatment as the #2 pain point.
      #priority:medium #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-03-05

- [x] P0.7: Use-case page: "Joining a ctx Project" — team onboarding guide. What
      to read first, how to check context health, starting your first session,
      adding context, session etiquette, common pitfalls. Currently
      undocumented. #priority:medium #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-03-05

- [x] P0.8: Use-case page: "Keeping AI Honest" — unique ctx differentiator.
      Covers confabulation problem, grounded memory via context files,
      anti-hallucination rules in AGENT_PLAYBOOK, verification loop,
      ctx drift for detecting stale context. #priority:medium
      #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-03-05

- [x] P0.9: Expand comparison page with specific tool comparisons: .cursorrules,
      Aider --read, Copilot @workspace, Cline memory, Windsurf rules.
      Current page positions against categories but not the specific tools
      users are evaluating. #priority:low #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-03-05

- [x] P0.10: FAQ page: collect answers to common questions currently scattered
      across docs — Why markdown? Does it work offline? What gets committed?
      How big should my token budget be? Why not a database?
      #priority:low #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-03-05

- [x] P0.11: Enhance security page for team workflows: code review for .context/
      files, gitignore patterns, team conventions for context management,
      multi-developer sharing. #priority:low #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-03-05

- [x] P0.12: Version history changelog summaries: each version entry should have
      2-3 bullet points describing key changes, not just a link to the
      source tree. #priority:low #source:report-7 #added:2026-02-17 #done:2026-03-05

**Agent Team Strategies** (from `ideas/REPORT-8-agent-teams.md`):
8 team compositions proposed. Reference material, not tasks. Key takeaways:

- [x] P0.13: Document agent team recipes in `hack/` or `.context/`: team
      compositions for feature dev (3 agents), consolidation sprint
      (3-4 agents), release prep (2 agents), doc sprint (3 agents).
      Include coordination patterns and anti-patterns. #priority:low #source:report-8 #done:2026-03-05

### Phase 9: Context Consolidation Skill `#priority:medium`

**Context**: `/ctx-consolidate` skill that groups overlapping entries by keyword
similarity and merges them with user approval. Originals archived, not deleted.
Spec: `specs/context-consolidation.md`
Ref: https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/issues/19 (Phase 3)

### Phase 10: Architecture Mapping Skill (`/ctx-map`)

**Context**: Skill that incrementally builds and maintains ARCHITECTURE.md
and DETAILED_DESIGN.md. Coverage tracked in map-tracking.json.
Spec: `specs/ctx-map.md`

### Docs: Knowledge Health

- [x] DK.1: Create recipe for knowledge health flow: nudge detection → review →
      `/ctx-consolidate` → archive originals. The old `knowledge-scaling.md`
      recipe was deleted; this replaces it with the nudge-based approach.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-21 #done:2026-03-05
- [x] DK.2: Add consolidation cross-link to `knowledge-capture.md` "See also"
      section. #priority:low #added:2026-02-21 — already present #done:2026-03-05

## Later

- [ ] PM.8: Add ctx system prune to clean stale per-session state files from .context/state/. Two candidate strategies: (1) prune files for sessions with no matching JSONL in ~/.claude/projects/, (2) prune state files older than N days (default 7). Decide at implementation time. Currently ~6 files per session accumulate forever (context-check, ctx-loaded, heartbeat, heartbeat-mtime, persistence-nudge, jsonl-path). #priority:medium #added:2026-03-05-045948

- [ ] P0.5: Blog: "Building a Claude Code Marketplace Plugin" — narrative from session
      history, journals, and git diff of feat/plugin-conversion branch.
      Covers: motivation (shell hooks to Go subcommands), plugin directory
      layout, marketplace.json, eliminating make plugin, bugs found during
      dogfooding (hooks creating partial .context/), and the fix. Use
      /ctx-blog-changelog with branch diff as source material. #added:2026-02-16-111948
- [ ] P9.2: Test manually on this project's LEARNINGS.md (20+ entries).
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-19
- [ ] P0.8.1: Install golangci-lint on the integration server #for-human
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-23 #added:2026-02-23-170213
- [ ] PM.1: Add topic-based navigation to blog when post count reaches 15+ #priority:low #added:2026-02-07-015054
- [ ] PM.2: Revisit Recipes nav structure when count reaches ~25 — consider grouping
      into sub-sections (Sessions, Knowledge, Security, Advanced) to reduce
      sidebar crowding. Currently at 18. #priority:low #added:2026-02-20
- [ ] PM.3: Review hook diagnostic logs after a long session. Check
      `.context/logs/check-persistence.log` and
       `.context/logs/check-context-size.log` to verify hooks fire correctly.
       Tune nudge frequency if needed. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-09
- [ ] PM.4: Run `/consolidate` to address codebase drift. Considerable drift has
      accumulated (predicate naming, magic strings, hardcoded permissions,
      godoc style). #priority:medium #added:2026-02-06
- [ ] PM.5: Add `--date` or `--since`/`--until` flags to `ctx recall list` for
      date range filtering. Currently the agent eyeballs dates from the
      full list output, which works but is inefficient for large session
      histories. #priority:low #added:2026-02-09
- [ ] PM.6: Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md: add architecture overview for contributors
      (package map), how to add a new command (pattern to follow), how to
      add a new parser (interface to implement), how to create a skill
      (directory structure), and test expectations per package. Lowers the
      contribution barrier. #priority:medium #source:report-6 #added:2026-02-17
- [ ] PM.7: Aider/Cursor parser implementations: the recall architecture was
      designed for extensibility (tool-agnostic Session type with
      tool-specific parsers). Adding basic Aider and Cursor parsers would
      validate the parser interface, broaden the user base, and fulfill
      the "works with any AI tool" promise. Aider format is simpler than
      Claude Code's. #priority:medium #source:report-6 #added:2026-02-17

## Future

- [ ] P0.8.5: Enable webhook notifications in worktrees. Currently `ctx notify`
      silently fails because `.context.key` is gitignored and absent in
      worktrees. For autonomous runs with opaque worktree agents, notifications
      are the one feature that would genuinely be useful. Possible approaches:
      resolve the key via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to find the main
      checkout, or copy the key into worktrees at creation time (ctx-worktree
      skill). #priority:medium #added:2026-02-22
- [ ] P0.9.2: Split cli-reference.md (1633 lines) into command group pages:
  cli-overview, cli-init-status, cli-context, cli-recall, cli-tools, cli-system —
  each page covers a natural command group with its subcommands and flags
  #added:2026-02-24-204208
- [ ] P0.9.3: Investigate proactive content suggestions: docs/recipes/publishing.md claims
  agents suggest blog posts and journal rebuilds at natural moments, but no hook
  or playbook mechanism exists to trigger this — either wire it up (e.g.
  post-task-completion nudge) or tone down the docs to match reality
  #added:2026-02-24-185754
- [ ] PG.1: Add agent/tool compatibility matrix to prompting guide — document which
      patterns degrade gracefully when agents lack file access, CLI tools, or
      ctx integration. Treat as a "works best with / degrades to" table.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-25
- [ ] PG.2: Add versioning/stability note to prompting guide — "these principles are
      stable; examples evolve" + doc date in frontmatter. Needed once the guide
      becomes canonical and people start quoting it. #priority:low #added:2026-02-25
- [ ] P0.1: Brainstorm: Standardize drift-check comment format and integrate with
  `/ctx-drift` — formalize ad-hoc `<!-- drift-check: ... -->` markers, teach
  drift skill to parse/execute them, publish pattern in docs/recipes. Benefits
  tooling/CLI but AI handles ad-hoc fine for now. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-28
- [ ] F.1: MCP server integration: expose context as tools/resources via Model
  Context Protocol. Would enable deep integration with any
  MCP-compatible client. #priority:low #source:report-6
