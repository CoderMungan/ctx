## `ctx` (*Context*)

> **`ctx` is a system, not a prompt.**

A lightweight, file-based system that enables AI coding assistants to persist,
structure, and rehydrate project context across sessions.

`ctx` works with **any AI tool** that can read files; no model or 
vendor lock-in.

## The `ctx` Manifesto

> **Creation, not code. Context, not prompts. Verification, not vibes.**

`ctx` is infrastructure for preserving intent under scale. Without durable
context, intelligence resets. With `ctx`, creation compounds.

## The Thesis

> **Context as State: A Persistence Layer for Human-AI Cognition**

AI-assisted development systems assemble context at prompt time using heuristic
retrieval from mutable sources. These approaches optimize relevance at the moment
of generation but provide no mechanism for persistence, verification, or
accumulated learning across sessions. `ctx` treats context as deterministic state.

## The Problem

Most LLM-driven development fails not because models are weak: They fail because
**context is ephemeral**. Every new session starts near zero:

* You re-explain architecture
* The AI repeats past mistakes
* Decisions get rediscovered instead of remembered

## The Solution

`ctx` treats context as infrastructure:

* **Persist**: Tasks, decisions, learnings survive session boundaries
* **Reuse**: Decisions don't get rediscovered; lessons stay learned
* **Align**: Context structure mirrors how engineers actually think
* **Integrate**: Works with any AI tool that can read files

Here's what that looks like in practice:

```text
❯ "Do you remember?"

● Yes. The PreToolUse hook runs ctx agent, and CLAUDE.md tells me to
  read the context files. I have context.

❯ "What have we been working on recently?"

● Yes. I can run ctx journal source and review recent activity:
    - 2025-01-20: The meta-experiment that started it all
    - 2025-01-21: The ctx rename + Claude hooks session
```

That's the whole point: **Temporal continuity across sessions**.

## Installation

Download pre-built binaries from the
[releases page](https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx/releases), or build from
source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ActiveMemory/ctx.git
cd ctx
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ctx ./cmd/ctx
sudo mv ctx /usr/local/bin/
```

See [installation docs](https://ctx.ist/#installation) for platform-specific
instructions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize context directory in your project
ctx init

# Check context status
ctx status

# Get an AI-ready context packet
ctx agent --budget 4000

# Add tasks, decisions, learnings
ctx add task "Implement user authentication"
ctx add decision "Use PostgreSQL for primary database" \
  --context "Need a reliable database for production workloads" \
  --rationale "PostgreSQL offers ACID compliance, JSON support, and team familiarity" \
  --consequence "Team needs PostgreSQL training; must set up replication"
ctx add learning "Mock functions must be hoisted in Jest"
```
